# Anthropogenic change and biodiversity

## Learning outcomes
Students will:
- have exposure to ideas of habitat area, in theory and practice, as it relates to anthropogenic drivers and conservation
- have a sense that tipping points in biodiversity and ecosystems are possible, but we don't understand them
- have a sense that historical approaches have made false presumptions about ecological mechanisms and social-natural relationships/dichotomies
- know how to begin in incorporate insights from ecology into their research


## Outline

- Biodiversity: beautiful and essential
    - biodiversity ethics (?)
    - biodiversity and ecosystem function
    - ecosystem services

    - often tied to area co-opted by human activities

- Species area relationship
    - in practice?
    - METE?
- Applications of IBT and SAR to conservation
    - SLOSS as a dead end
    - evolutionary novelty
- Where are all the extinctions?
    - extinction debt
    - spatial configuration
    - false dichotomy between human use and nature
- Open questions
    - resource limited or "network" limited?
    - is biodiversity driven by reversible or irreversible processes?
    - extent of dichotomy between humans and nature
